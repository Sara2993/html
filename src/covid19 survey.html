    <h1>introduction</h1>

    <p>We all have been affected by the current <b>COVID-19 pandemic.</b><br>
         However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society.<br>
          While some try to adapt to working online, <br>homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. 
          Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p>

<h2>Disproportional impact of COVID-19 on African Americans</h2>
</div>
<p>As noted by <b>Samuel Dickman et al</b>.:<br>

    economic inequality in the US has been increasing for decades and is now among the highest in developed countries … <br>As economic inequality in the US has deepened, so too has inequality in health. 
    Both overall and government health spending are higher in the US than in other countries, yet inadequate insurance coverage, high-cost sharing by patients, and geographical barriers restrict access to care for many.[8]</div>
 <div>
</p>For instance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation,<b> in 2018, 11.7% of African Americans</b> in the United States had no health insurance, compared to 7.5% of whites.[9]
</div>
<br> 
    Prior to the Affordable Care Act—enacted into law<b>in 2010—about 20% of African Americans</b> were uninsured. This act helped lower the uninsured rate among nonelderly African Americans by more than one-third between 2013 and 2016, from 18.9% to 11.7%. However, even after the law’s passage, African Americans have higher uninsured rates than whites (7.5%) and Asian Americans (6.3%).[10] The uninsured are far more likely than the insured to forgo needed medical visits, tests, treatments, and medications because of cost.</p>

    <p>Similarly, American Public Media reported on the COVID-19 mortality rate by race/ethnicity through <b>July 21, 2020</b>, <br>including Washington, DC, and 45 states (see figure 1). 
    These data, while showing an alarming death rate for all races,<br> demonstrate how minorities are hit harder and how, among minority groups, the African American population in many states bears the brunt of the pandemic’s health impact.</p>

<div>
<p>Approximately 97.9 out of every 100,000 African Americans have died from COVID-19</p>
</div>
<div>
     <ul>
         <li>a mortality rate that is a third higher than that for Latinos (64.7 per 100,000)</li>
         <li> more than double than that for whites (46.6 per 100,000) </li>
         <li>Asians (40.4 per 100,000)</li>
         </ul>
         </div>
     <p>The overrepresentation of African Americans among confirmed COVID-19 cases and number of deaths underscores the fact that the coronavirus pandemic,</p>
     <div>
     <ol>
         <li>far from being an equalizer</li> 
         <li>amplifying or even worsening existing social inequalities tied to race</li>
         <li> class, and access to the health care system.</li>
         </ol>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In 1966,<b> Dr. Martin Luther King Jr</b>. said, “Of all forms of inequality,<div> injustice in health is the most shocking and inhuman.”</div><br>More than 54 years later, African Americans still suffer from injustices that are at the basis of income and health disparities.<br> We know from previous experiences that epidemics place increased demands on scarce resources and enormous stress on social and economic systems.</p>
